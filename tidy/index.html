        <h2 class="gallery-section-title">paintings</h2>
        <p class="gallery-section-description">giving myself permission to paint abstract works that are personal to my energy, rather than creating pieces that are easily identifiable, is a hurdle i have overcome in the last year. painting from authenticity, feeling, and surrender has taught me a level of trust in my inner voice that i am still learning to strengthen. i moved through the heartbreak of a decade-long relationship over the last year, which left me unsure of how to rebuild both my sense of self and my way of relating to others, especially as new connections began to enter my life. these three abstract paintings reflect the different layered energies i hold within myself. through studying myself through astrology, i've come to understand these layers more clearly. at first impression, i can be expressive, open, innovative, and community-centered, reflected through my aquarius rising. as you get to know me, you'll meet my deep need to nurture and care, guided by my cancer moon. and for those who enter my inner world, my scorpio sun is intense, loyal, and deeply committed.</p>

        <h2 class="gallery-section-title">ceramics</h2>
        <p class="gallery-section-description">the medium of clay offers many ways to be experienced. i discovered that my most natural way is through handbuilding. shaping, guiding, and witnessing the vessel come to life, slowly but surely. there is something deeply intuitive, raw, and meditative about the process that allows me to be incredibly present with my mind, body, and spirit. it allows me to align to my truth as the distractions that make up my days fade into the background, and the only thing that matters is my hands and what i am trying to create. these works are my first two large-scale vessels and my first exploration into ceramic lighting.</p>
