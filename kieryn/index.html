                <p>4 selected works from my spring + summer 2024 series. the series was a painted reflection of my inner and outer landscapes… in a state of transition, just like the seasons, i painted the emotionality of everything that was moving in and around me.</p>
                <p>painting this body of work, i found a sense of confidence in my voice, color theory, technique, medium, and overall sensibility.</p>
                <p>in 2025 i curated a show with this series in my apartment. so much came together with it, and i saw the through line of what was being communicated in the pieces.</p>
                <p>i titled the show "moving on" because the whole time i was painting i was moving homes, moving on in relationships, moving in my painting practice, and ultimately moving myself forward in life. all while sensing what was moving around me in nature, humanity, and the world at large.</p>
                <p>this body of work taught me that movement is constant but you can capture a moment and make it forever lasting with a painting.</p>
                <p>as an artist—and especially a female artist—i paint because i have so much to say, and this is one of the places it feels safe enough to say it fully. i paint abstract because it doesn't matter to me what it is, or if it even makes sense— it only matters to me how it feels.</p>
